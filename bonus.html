        Bruce Wayne was a child when he witnessed the murder of his parents.
        The grief-stricken boy dedicated his existence to avenging their murders by “spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals.”
        He chose a bat as the basis for his crime-fighting disguise and thus became Batman.
