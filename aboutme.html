        <h2>A Passage to India</h2>
        <p>The possibility of friendship and connection between English and Indian people, despite their cultural differences and imperial tensions, is explored in the conflict.
           The novel’s colorful descriptions of nature, the landscape of India, and the figurative power that they are given within the text solidifies it as a great work of fiction.
